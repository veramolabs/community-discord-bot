## Community Discord Bot

Discord bot for the [VeramoLabs server](https://discord.gg/FRRBdjemHV)

The community bot is intended to help the Veramo community achieve two things:
- Create a rewarding system. A reward is one of the most important strategies to implement in communities because every human loves receiving rewards for good deeds carried out. Be it studying, helping out someone, contributing to a project, etc.
- Provide a use case for the veramo framework, which can be showcased to the community, at events, and to users.

Some of the possible upsides of the community bot include
- Community engagement can be measured through the number of VCs collected 
- Every VC issued increases the strength and validity of all VC collection identities
- These VCs can be show-cased in and outside the community
- When hiring in the crypto space, employers can use an applicantâ€™s VC collection as a reliable record of their involvement in a community.
- We can determine who qualifies for Veramo ambassadorship by the number of VCs they get (An ambassadorship program)
